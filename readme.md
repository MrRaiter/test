Hi!

First you should start the server with this commands
```
git clone https://github.com/MrRaiter/test
cd ./test/test-server
npm start
```

After that you should start main page from new terminal
```
cd ./test
npm i 
npm start
```
Thats all!

There's only three tests for front-end, but if you would like to fire them use
```
npm run test
```
